  abstract = {<p>Signaling and regulatory pathways that guide gene expression have
	only been partially defined for most organisms. However, given the
	increasing number of microarray measurements, it may be possible
	to reconstruct such pathways and uncover missing connections directly
	from experimental data. Using a compendium of microarray gene expression
	data obtained from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, we constructed
	a series of Bayesian network models for the reactive oxygen species
	(ROS) pathway as defined by EcoCyc. A consensus Bayesian network
	model was generated using those networks sharing the top recovered
	score. This microarray-based network only partially agreed with the
	known ROS pathway curated from the literature and databases. A top
	network was then expanded to predict genes that could enhance the
	Bayesian network model using an algorithm we termed â€˜BN+1â€™. This
	expansion procedure predicted many stress-related genes (e.g., <italic>dusB</italic>
	and <italic>uspE</italic>), and their possible interactions with
	other ROS pathway genes. A term enrichment method discovered that
	biofilm-associated microarray data usually contained high expression
	levels of both <italic>uspE</italic> and <italic>gadX</italic>. The
	predicted involvement of gene <italic>uspE</italic> in the ROS pathway
	and interactions between <italic>uspE</italic> and <italic>gadX</italic>
	were confirmed experimentally using <italic>E. coli</italic> reporter
	strains. Genes <italic>gadX</italic> and <italic>uspE</italic> showed
	a feedback relationship in regulating each other's expression. Both
	genes were verified to regulate biofilm formation through gene knockout
	experiments. These data suggest that the BN+1 expansion method can
	faithfully uncover hidden or unknown genes for a selected pathway
	with significant biological roles. The presently reported BN+1 expansion
	method is a generalized approach applicable to the characterization
	and expansion of other biological pathways and living systems.</p>},

  abstract = {Analysing animal health data can be a complex task as the health status
	of individuals or groups of animals, might depend on many inter-related
	variables. The objective is to differentiate variables that are directly
	associated with health status and therefore promising targets for
	intervention, from variables that are indirectly associated with
	health status and can therefore at best only affect this indirectly
	through association with other variables. Bayesian network (BN) modelling
	is a machine learning technique for empirically identifying associations
	in complex and high dimensional data, so-called "structure discovery".
	An introduction to structure discovery using BN modelling is presented,
	comprising the key assumptions required by the methodology, along
	with a discussion of advantages and limitations. To demonstrate the
	various steps required to apply BN structure discovery to animal
	health data, illustrative analyses of data collected during a previously
	published study concerned with exposure to bovine viral diarrhoea
	virus in beef cow-calf herds in Scotland are presented. (C) 2011

  abstract = {The addition of asparagine (N)-linked polysaccharide chains (i.e.,
	glycans) to the gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency
	virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope is not only required for correct protein
	folding, but also may provide protection against neutralizing antibodies
	as a "glycan shield." As a result, strong host-specific selection
	is frequently associated with codon positions where nonsynonymous
	substitutions can create or disrupt potential N-linked glycosylation
	sites (PNGSs). Moreover, empirical data suggest that the individual
	contribution of PNGSs to the neutralization sensitivity or infectivity
	of HIV-1 may be critically dependent on the presence or absence of
	other PNGSs in the envelope sequence. Here we evaluate how glycan-glycan
	interactions have shaped the evolution of HIV-1 envelope sequences
	by analyzing the distribution of PNGSs in a large-sequence alignment.
	Using a "covarion"- type phylogenetic model, we find that the rates
	at which individual PNGSs are gained or lost vary significantly over
	time, suggesting that the selective advantage of having a PNGS may
	depend on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the sequence.
	Consequently, we identify specific interactions between PNGSs in
	the alignment using a new paired-character phylogenetic model of
	evolution, and a Bayesian graphical model. Despite the fundamental
	differences between these two methods, several interactions are jointly
	identified by both. Mapping these interactions onto a structural
	model of HIV-1 gp120 reveals that negative (exclusive) interactions
	occur significantly more often between colocalized glycans, while
	positive (inclusive) interactions are restricted to more distant
	glycans. Our results imply that the adaptive repertoire of alternative
	configurations in the HIV-1 glycan shield is limited by functional
	interactions between the N-linked glycans. This represents a potential
	vulnerability of rapidly evolving HIV-1 populations that may provide
	useful glycan-based targets for neutralizing antibodies. },
