  Abstract                 = {In recent years there has been significant progress in algorithms and methods for inducing Bayesian networks from data. However, in complex data analysis problems, we need to go beyond being satisfied with inducing networks with high scores. We need to provide confidence measures on features of these networks: Is the existence of an edge between two nodes warranted? Is the Markov blanket of a given node robust? Can we say something about the ordering of the variables? We should be able to address these questions, even when the amount of data is not enough to induce a high scoring network. In this paper we propose Efron's Bootstrap as a computationally efficient approach far answering these questions. In addition, we propose to use these confidence measures to induce better structures from the data, and to detect the presence of latent variables.},

  Abstract                 = {In many multivariate domains, we are interested in analyzing the dependency structure of the underlying distribution, e.g., whether two variables are in direct interaction. We can represent dependency structures using Bayesian network models. To analyze a given data set, Bayesian model selection attempts to find the most likely (MAP) model, and uses its structure to answer these questions. However, when the amount of available data is modest, there might be many models that have non-negligible posterior. Thus, we want compute the Bayesian posterior of a feature, i.e., the total posterior probability of all models that contain it. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this task. We first show how to efficiently compute a sum over the exponential number of networks that are consistent with a fixed order over network variables. This allows us to compute, for a given order, both the marginal probability of the data and the posterior of a feature. We then use this result as the basis for an algorithm that approximates the Bayesian posterior of a feature. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, but over orders rather than over network structures. The space of orders is smaller and more regular than the space of structures, and has much a smoother posterior "landscape". We present empirical results on synthetic and real-life datasets that compare our approach to full model averaging (when possible), to MCMC over network structures, and to a non-Bayesian bootstrap approach.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. First and foremost, we develop a methodology for assessing informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived from a set of assumptions made previously as well as the assumption of likelihood equivalence, which says that data should not help to discriminate network structures that represent the same assertions of conditional independence. We show that likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made assumptions implies that the user's priors for network parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the next case to be seen-a prior network-and a single measure of confidence for that network. Second, using these priors, we show how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network structures given data. Third, we describe search methods for identifying network structures with high posterior probabilities. We describe polynomial algorithms for finding the highest-scoring network structures in the special case where every node has at most k = 1 parent. For the general case (k > 1), which is NP-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms including local search, iterative local search, and simulated annealing. Finally, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms, and apply this approach to a comparison of various approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Signaling and regulatory pathways that guide gene expression have only been partially defined for most organisms. However, given the increasing number of microarray measurements, it may be possible to reconstruct such pathways and uncover missing connections directly from experimental data. Using a compendium of microarray gene expression data obtained from Escherichia coli, we constructed a series of Bayesian network models for the reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway as defined by EcoCyc. A consensus Bayesian network model was generated using those networks sharing the top recovered score. This microarray-based network only partially agreed with the known ROS pathway curated from the literature and databases. A top network was then expanded to predict genes that could enhance the Bayesian network model using an algorithm we termed 'BN+1'. This expansion procedure predicted many stress-related genes (e. g., dusB and uspE), and their possible interactions with other ROS pathway genes. A term enrichment method discovered that biofilm-associated microarray data usually contained high expression levels of both uspE and gadX. The predicted involvement of gene uspE in the ROS pathway and interactions between uspE and gadX were confirmed experimentally using E. coli reporter strains. Genes gadX and uspE showed a feedback relationship in regulating each other's expression. Both genes were verified to regulate biofilm formation through gene knockout experiments. These data suggest that the BN+1 expansion method can faithfully uncover hidden or unknown genes for a selected pathway with significant biological roles. The presently reported BN+1 expansion method is a generalized approach applicable to the characterization and expansion of other biological pathways and living systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning a Bayesian network structure from data is a well-motivated but computationally hard task. We present an algorithm that computes the exact posterior probability of a subnetwork, e. g., a directed edge; a modified version of the algorithm finds one of the most probable network structures. This algorithm runs in time O(n2(n) + n(k+1)C(m)), where n is the number of network variables, k is a constant maximum in-degree, and C(m) is the cost of computing a single local marginal conditional likelihood for m data instances. This is the first algorithm with less than super-exponential complexity with respect to n. Exact computation allows us to tackle complex cases where existing Monte Carlo methods and local search procedures potentially fail. We show that also in domains with a large number of variables, exact computation is feasible, given suitable a priori restrictions on the structures; combining exact and inexact methods is also possible. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented algorithm on four synthetic data sets with 17, 22, 37, and 100 variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysing animal health data can be a complex task as the health status of individuals or groups of animals, might depend on many inter-related variables. The objective is to differentiate variables that are directly associated with health status and therefore promising targets for intervention, from variables that are indirectly associated with health status and can therefore at best only affect this indirectly through association with other variables. Bayesian network (BN) modelling is a machine learning technique for empirically identifying associations in complex and high dimensional data, so-called "structure discovery". An introduction to structure discovery using BN modelling is presented, comprising the key assumptions required by the methodology, along with a discussion of advantages and limitations. To demonstrate the various steps required to apply BN structure discovery to animal health data, illustrative analyses of data collected during a previously published study concerned with exposure to bovine viral diarrhoea virus in beef cow-calf herds in Scotland are presented.

  Abstract                 = {The addition of asparagine (N)-linked polysaccharide chains (i.e., glycans) to the gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope is not only required for correct protein folding, but also may provide protection against neutralizing antibodies as a "glycan shield." As a result, strong host-specific selection is frequently associated with codon positions where nonsynonymous substitutions can create or disrupt potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs). Moreover, empirical data suggest that the individual contribution of PNGSs to the neutralization sensitivity or infectivity of HIV-1 may be critically dependent on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the envelope sequence. Here we evaluate how glycan-glycan interactions have shaped the evolution of HIV-1 envelope sequences by analyzing the distribution of PNGSs in a large-sequence alignment. Using a "covarion"- type phylogenetic model, we find that the rates at which individual PNGSs are gained or lost vary significantly over time, suggesting that the selective advantage of having a PNGS may depend on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the sequence. Consequently, we identify specific interactions between PNGSs in the alignment using a new paired-character phylogenetic model of evolution, and a Bayesian graphical model. Despite the fundamental differences between these two methods, several interactions are jointly identified by both. Mapping these interactions onto a structural model of HIV-1 gp120 reveals that negative (exclusive) interactions occur significantly more often between colocalized glycans, while positive (inclusive) interactions are restricted to more distant glycans. Our results imply that the adaptive repertoire of alternative configurations in the HIV-1 glycan shield is limited by functional interactions between the N-linked glycans. This represents a potential vulnerability of rapidly evolving HIV-1 populations that may provide useful glycan-based targets for neutralizing antibodies.},

  Abstract                 = {Logistic regression techniques can be used to restrict the conditional probabilities of a Bayesian network for discrete variables. More specifically, each variable of the network can be modeled through a logistic regression model, in which the parents of the variable define the covariates. When all main effects and interactions between the parent variables are incorporated as covariates, the conditional probabilities are estimated without restrictions, as in a traditional Bayesian network. By incorporating interaction terms up to a specific order only, the number of parameters can be drastically reduced. Furthermore, ordered logistic regression can be used when the categories of a variable are ordered, resulting in even more parsimonious models. Parameters are estimated by a modified junction tree algorithm. The approach is illustrated with the Alarm network. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
